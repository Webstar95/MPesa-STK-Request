# MPesa-STK-Request
PhP script that facilitates an M-Pesa sim toolkit request to your desired safaricom line.

For this to work, you need to create an app on the safaricom developer website; https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/user/me/apps.  
Select both MPesa Sandbox and Lipa na MPesa sandbox products on the app creation. 
From the app description, you'll find the consumer key and secret. 
For the test credentials you'll find them on, https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/test_credentials.

You can then test on your server or localhost. For production purposes, visit https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/docs to gather more information
on the procedure as well as more insight into this code and other apis offered by Safaricom.

Thank you!
